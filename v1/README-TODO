EKG is the set of tools that measures the heartbeat of various
communities.  Its goal is to measure participation along a number
of dimensions, and to use those metrics to help assess the overall
"community fitness" of a project.

The components are:

1. mlparsers.  Parses a mailing list into a sqlite db.  Very simple, with
   the goal of creating a bunch of raw data to be mined for various
   purposes.  Currently there's a script for RH lists and a script for
   JBoss lists.

2. grapher.  Draws a bunch of graphs based on data pulled from ml.db.

3. tools.  Various crap.

TODO:

0. Kill the current db and replace it with the old one.
1. Build a mysql DB and refactor scripts to use it instead
2. Pull in a bunch more listdata.  Great candidates:
  * https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/
  * The hibernate devel list (again)
